# Douyin Scraper API - Videos, Creators, Comments, Search

Pull Douyin (the Chinese TikTok) videos, user profiles and feeds, comments, hashtags, music, live rooms, the hot-search board, and run keyword search across videos, users, music, live and hashtags. All endpoints return structured JSON.

## When to trigger

Use this skill when the user asks to:
- Pull a Douyin video's full detail or statistics (play, like, share, download counts), or resolve a share link
- Read a user's profile, their posts, their liked videos, followers or following, or their current live stream
- Read a video's comments and comment replies, or videos recommended alongside it
- Look up a hashtag or a sound (music) and the videos under it
- Read the hot-search board, the recommended home feed, or a live room by `web_rid`
- Search Douyin by keyword - general, or scoped to videos, users, music, live streams or hashtags
- Do China-market social research, creator analysis or trend spotting on Douyin

## Setup

Get a free API key at [scavio.dev](https://scavio.dev/?utm_source=agent-skills&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=douyin-scraper-api) (50 free credits to get started, no card required):

```bash
export SCAVIO_API_KEY=sk_live_your_key
```

### If you do not have a key yet

An agent running this skill without `SCAVIO_API_KEY` set will get `401` on every
call below. The whole path from nothing to a working key is self-serve:

1. Sign up at [dashboard.scavio.dev](https://dashboard.scavio.dev/sign-up?utm_source=agent-skills&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=douyin-scraper-api) - email or Google, no card required.
2. A key is created for the account automatically at signup. It is on the dashboard under API Keys, ready to copy.
3. A new account starts with 50 credits. Endpoints in this skill cost 1 credit each unless the table below says otherwise.

When the balance runs out the API answers `402` with a JSON body carrying
`billing_url`. Topping up needs no code change - the same key keeps working.
The smallest purchase is 2,500 credits for $25, and monthly plans work out
cheaper per credit if the usage is steady rather than one-off.

Every request is a `POST` with a JSON body and:

```
Authorization: Bearer $SCAVIO_API_KEY
```

## Pricing

Base URL: `https://api.scavio.dev`.

- **Search endpoints (`/api/v1/douyin/search*`) cost 10 credits** each.

## Key identifiers

- **`aweme_id`** - a video id (e.g. `7436613508646702348`). Used by `video`, `video/statistics`, `video/comments`, `video/comment-replies`, `related`.
- **`sec_user_id`** - a user id (the `MS4wLjABAAAA...` string). Used by the user endpoints. Get it from `resolve/user-id` if you only have a profile URL.
- Feed/comment endpoints paginate with `max_cursor` / `cursor` / `max_time` from the previous response, and take an optional `count` (1-50).

## Examples

```python
import requests

BASE = "https://api.scavio.dev"
# Your key from https://scavio.dev. Load it from your environment or secret
# store in real code - keep it out of source control.
API_KEY = "sk_your_key_here"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}

# 1. Resolve a share link, then read that video's comments (1 credit each)
video = requests.post(f"{BASE}/api/v1/douyin/video/by-share-url", headers=HEADERS,
    json={"share_url": "https://v.douyin.com/v1zNJi__Teg/"}).json()
aweme_id = video["data"]["aweme_id"]
comments = requests.post(f"{BASE}/api/v1/douyin/video/comments", headers=HEADERS,
    json={"aweme_id": aweme_id, "count": 50}).json()

# 2. Resolve a profile URL to a user id, then read the user's posts (1 credit each)
uid = requests.post(f"{BASE}/api/v1/douyin/resolve/user-id", headers=HEADERS,
    json={"url": "https://www.douyin.com/user/"}).json()["data"]["sec_user_id"]
posts = requests.post(f"{BASE}/api/v1/douyin/user/posts", headers=HEADERS,
    json={"sec_user_id": uid, "count": 20}).json()

# 3. Keyword search - 10 credits
found = requests.post(f"{BASE}/api/v1/douyin/search/videos", headers=HEADERS,
    json={"keyword": "美食"}).json()
```

curl:

```bash
curl -s https://api.scavio.dev/api/v1/douyin/trending \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCAVIO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

## Response shape

Every response uses the envelope `{ data, response_time, credits_used, credits_remaining }`. `data` carries the video / user / feed payload, with lists under keys like `videos`, `comments`, `users` and cursors for pagination.

## Guardrails

- **Search costs 10 credits per call; everything else costs 1.** Confirm with `credits_used` and avoid running search in tight loops.
- Use `resolve/video-id` and `resolve/user-id` to turn a Douyin URL into the id the other endpoints need.
- Paginate only with the cursor the previous response returned (`max_cursor` / `cursor` / `max_time`); stop when it stops advancing.
- Trending, hot-search and rankings are point-in-time snapshots - re-fetch for a fresh board rather than assuming stability.
- Never fabricate video counts, comment text, follower numbers or user details. Only return what the API returned.
- Comments and profiles are written by real people. Summarise; do not build profiles of individuals.

## Failure handling

- `400` means malformed input (e.g. a bad URL). Fix and retry.
- `401` means the API key is invalid or missing. Check `SCAVIO_API_KEY`.
- `422` means a required identifier is missing (e.g. no `sec_user_id`). Supply it and retry.
- `429` means rate or usage limit exceeded. Wait before retrying. See [rate limits](https://scavio.dev/docs/rate-limits?utm_source=agent-skills&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=douyin-scraper-api).
- `502` means the source is temporarily unavailable - wait a few seconds and retry.
- If `SCAVIO_API_KEY` is not set, prompt the user to export it before continuing.
